```scala
val neighbours = nbrRange()
val distances = foldhoodPlus((Double.PositiveInfinity, Set[ID]()))((acc, v) => {
  val (dist, ids) = acc
  val newDist = Math.min(dist, nbrVar[Double]("distance"))
  val newIds = ids + nbrlid
  (newDist, newIds)
}, (0.0, Set(self.id)))
val minDist = distances._1
