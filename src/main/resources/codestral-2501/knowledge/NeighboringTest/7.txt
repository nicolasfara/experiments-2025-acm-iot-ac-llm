Certainly! Based on the DSL for aggregate computing, you can count the neighbors (including the node itself) using the `foldhood` construct. Here is the raw Scala code for counting neighbors:

```scala
foldhood(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))
```

This code will count the number of neighbors, including the current node, using the `foldhood` function. Each node contributes `1` to the count, and the results are combined across the neighborhood.
