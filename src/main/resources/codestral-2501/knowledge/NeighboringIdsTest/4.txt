To gather a list of IDs of their neighbors in the distributed system, you can use the `nbr` and `foldhood` constructs. Here is how you can write the body of the `main` function to achieve this:

```scala
foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(List(nbr(mid())))
```

This code snippet does the following:
- `foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(List(nbr(mid())))`:
  - `List.empty[ID]`: Initializes an empty list.
  - `_ ++ _`: Combines the lists by concatenating them.
  - `List(nbr(mid()))`: Creates a list containing the neighbor's ID.

This will result in a list of IDs of all the neighbors of each node.
