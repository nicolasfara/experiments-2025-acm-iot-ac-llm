To gather a list of IDs of the neighbors of each node in the distributed system, you can use the `foldhood` construct to aggregate the IDs from all neighbors. Here's how you can do it:

```scala
foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(nbr(mid()))
```

This code snippet will collect the IDs of all neighbors, including the node itself, into a list.

Here is the complete `main` function body:

```scala
foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(nbr(mid()))
```

This will output a list of IDs of the neighbors for each node in the network.
