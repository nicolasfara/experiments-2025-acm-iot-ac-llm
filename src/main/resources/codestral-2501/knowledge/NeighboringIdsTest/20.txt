To gather a list of the IDs of their neighbors, you can use the `foldhood` construct to aggregate the neighbor IDs. Here is the Scala code for this task:

```scala
foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(List(nbr(mid())))
```

This code will collect the IDs of all neighbors, including the node itself, and combine them into a single list. If you want to exclude the node itself, you can use the `foldhoodPlus` construct instead:

```scala
foldhoodPlus(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(List(nbr(mid())))
```

This code will collect the IDs of only the neighbors, excluding the node itself.
