To calculate the minimum distance from neighbors in a distributed system using the provided DSL, you can follow these steps:

1. Use the `foldhood` construct to gather distances from neighbors.
2. Use the `minHood` construct to find the minimum distance among these gathered values.

Given the requirements, here is the resulting Scala code for the `main` function:

```scala
rep(Double.MaxValue) { minDist =>
  minHood(nbrRange())
}
```

This code snippet does the following:
- Uses `rep` to evolve the minimum distance over time.
- In each iteration, it uses `minHood` to find the minimum distance to neighbors.
- `nbrRange()` is used to get the distance to neighbors.

Here is the full code snippet:

```scala
rep(Double.MaxValue) { minDist =>
  minHood(nbrRange())
}
```
