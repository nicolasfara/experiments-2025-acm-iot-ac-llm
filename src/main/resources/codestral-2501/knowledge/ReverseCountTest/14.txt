To evolve a value from 1000 back to 0, you can use the `rep` construct in Scala. The `rep` construct allows you to evolve a value over time by applying a function to its previous value.

Here is the Scala code for evolving a value from 1000 to 0:

```scala
rep(1000)(_ - 1)
```

This code initializes the value to 1000 and decrements it by 1 on each iteration.
