```scala
def main(): Double = {
  val averageTemperature = foldhood(0.0)(_ + _)(nbr(sense[Double]("temperature"))) / foldhood(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))
  if (averageTemperature > 30) {
    foldhood(0.0)(_ + _)(nbr(if (averageTemperature > 30) 1.0 else 0.0))
  } else {
    0.0
  }
}
```

Here is the breakdown of the code:

1. **Calculate Average Temperature:**
   - `val averageTemperature = foldhood(0.0)(_ + _)(nbr(sense[Double]("temperature"))) / foldhood(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))`
     - This computes the average temperature of all neighbors, including itself.

2. **Check if Average Temperature is Above 30:**
   - `if (averageTemperature > 30)`
     - If the average temperature is above 30 degrees, proceed to the next step.

3. **Broadcast Alarm Within the Area:**
   - `foldhood(0.0)(_ + _)(nbr(if (averageTemperature > 30) 1.0 else 0.0))`
     - This broadcasts an alarm (represented as `1.0`) to all neighbors if the average temperature is above 30 degrees.
     - If the average temperature is not above 30 degrees, it returns `0.0`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - The result of the `foldhood` operation is returned, which represents the broadcasted alarm within the area.
