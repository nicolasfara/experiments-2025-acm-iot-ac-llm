To create a channel from a source node to a destination node in the context of the aggregate computing DSL, you would need to define the logic for setting up and maintaining the channel within the `main` function. Here's a possible implementation:

```scala
rep(0) { _ =>
  mux(sense[Boolean]("source")) {
    foldhood(()) { (_, _) => () } (nbr(mux(sense[Boolean]("destination")) {
      nbr(())
    } {
      ()
    }))
  } {
    ()
  }
}
```

Explanation:
1. **`rep(0) { _ => ... }`**: This construct ensures that the computation is repeated over time.
2. **`mux(sense[Boolean]("source")) { ... } { ... }`**: This construct checks if the current node is the source.
3. **`foldhood((())) { (_, _) => () } (nbr(...))`**: This construct aggregates data from neighbors.
4. **`nbr(mux(sense[Boolean]("destination")) { ... } { ... })`**: This checks if the neighbor is the destination.
5. **`nbr(())`**: This sends a message to the neighbor.
6. **`()`**: This represents an empty message.

This code sets up a channel from the source node to the destination node by repeatedly checking the conditions and propagating the message through the network.
