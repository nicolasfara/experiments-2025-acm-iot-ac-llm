Certainly! Below is the Scala code for creating a channel from a source node to a destination node, following the criteria and constraints specified:

```scala
branch(nbr(mid()) == "source") {
  nbrRange()
} {
  branch(nbr(mid()) == "destination") {
    nbr(nbrRange())
  } {
    0.0
  }
}
```

This code creates a channel from the node with `mid()` equal to `"source"` to the node with `mid()` equal to `"destination"`. The `branch` construct is used to determine which nodes are the source and destination, and `nbrRange()` is used to access the distance to the neighbor. If the neighbor is the destination, it returns the distance to the neighbor; otherwise, it returns `0.0`.
