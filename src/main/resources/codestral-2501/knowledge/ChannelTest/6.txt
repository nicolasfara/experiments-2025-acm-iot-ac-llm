To create a channel from a source node to a destination node in a distributed system, you can use the provided DSL constructs. Below is a Scala code snippet that accomplishes this task. It sets up a channel that allows the source node to send data to the destination node.

```scala
val sourceData = foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(nbr(mid()))
val destinationData = foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(nbr(mid()))

branch(sourceData.contains(mid())) {
  nbr(sense[Int]("sourceSignal"))
} {
  branch(destinationData.contains(mid())) {
    nbr(0)
  } {
    0
  }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Collecting Neighbor IDs**:
   - `val sourceData = foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(nbr(mid()))`: This line collects the IDs of all neighbors (including itself) into a list called `sourceData`.
   - `val destinationData = foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(nbr(mid()))`: Similarly, this line collects the IDs of all neighbors (including itself) into a list called `destinationData`.

2. **Branching Logic**:
   - The outer `branch` checks if the current node's ID (`mid()`) is in the `sourceData` list. If true, it means the current node is the source.
   - If the current node is the source, it sends the data (e.g., `sense[Int]("sourceSignal")`) to its neighbors.
   - If the current node is not the source, it checks if the current node's ID is in the `destinationData` list. If true, it means the current node is the destination.
   - If the current node is the destination, it receives data from its neighbors.
   - If the current node is neither the source nor the destination, it returns `0`.

This setup ensures that data flows from the source node to the destination node through the network.
