Certainly! Based on your requirements and the DSL explained, here is how you can create a channel from a source node to a destination node:

```scala
branch(sense[Boolean]("source")) {
  foldhood(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))
} {
  foldhood(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))
}
```

This code will:
1. Check if the current node is the source node using `sense[Boolean]("source")`.
2. If the current node is the source, it will count the number of neighbors (including itself) using `foldhood(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))`.
3. If the current node is not the source, it will also count the number of neighbors (including itself) using `foldhood(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))`.

This ensures that the channel from the source to the destination is created, and both nodes (source and destination) are considered in the network.
