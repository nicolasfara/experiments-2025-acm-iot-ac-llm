Given the requirement to count neighbors excluding the current node, we can use the `foldhoodPlus` construct. Here is the resulting Scala code for counting neighbors excluding the current node:

```scala
foldhoodPlus(0)(_ + _)(nbr(1))
```

This code will ensure that each node counts its neighbors (excluding itself) and outputs the total count.
