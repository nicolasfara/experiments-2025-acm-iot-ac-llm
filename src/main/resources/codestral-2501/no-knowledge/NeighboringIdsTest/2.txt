```scala
CaseClass[Neighbor](id: Int, neighborId: Int)

val neighborhoodEdges = Set(Neighbor(1, 2), Neighbor(1, 3), Neighbor(2, 4), Neighbor(3, 4))

val neighborIds = neighborhoodEdges.aggregate(
  Set[Int]()
)(
  { case (set, neighbor) => set + neighbor.neighborId },
  { _ ++ _ }

neighborIds.toList.sorted
