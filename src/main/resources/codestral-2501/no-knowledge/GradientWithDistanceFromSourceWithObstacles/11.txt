```scala
val distances = Sensor[Double]("distance")
val obstacles = Sensor[Boolean]("obstacle")
val source = Sensor[Double]("source")

val euclideanDistance = distances.compose(source) { (dist, src) =>
  if (obstacles.value) Double.PositiveInfinity else dist - src
}.fold(Double.PositiveInfinity) { (minDist, newDist) =>
  if (newDist < minDist) newDist else minDist
}
```
