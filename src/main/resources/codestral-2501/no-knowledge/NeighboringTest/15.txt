```scala
val graph = List(
  List(0, 1),
  List(0, 3),
  List(1, 2),
  List(2, 3)
)
val neighbors = Graph.fromEdgeList(graph, undirected = true)
val countNeighbors = neighbors.aggregateMessages(init = 0, send = (edge, count) => Iterator((edge.dst, count + 1)), combine = _ + _)
countNeighbors.toList
```
