To gather a list of neighbors' IDs using the DSL constructs provided, you can use the following Scala code:

```scala
foldhood(List[ID]())(_ ++ _)(List(nbr(mid())))
```

This snippet uses the `foldhood` construct to aggregate a list of neighbor IDs. Here's a breakdown of the components:
- `foldhood(List[ID]())(_ ++ _)(List(nbr(mid())))`: This expression combines the IDs of neighbors into a single list.
  - `List[ID]()`: Initial empty list of IDs.
  - `_ ++ _`: Combining function that concatenates two lists.
  - `List(nbr(mid()))`: Expression that gets the ID of a neighbor and wraps it in a list.
