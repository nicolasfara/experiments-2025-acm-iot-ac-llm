To gather a list of IDs of the neighbors of each node in a distributed system using the DSL, you can use the `nbr` construct to access the IDs of neighboring nodes. Here is the Scala code for the `main` function that collects these IDs:

```scala
foldhood(List.empty[ID])(_ ++ _)(List(nbr(mid())))
```
