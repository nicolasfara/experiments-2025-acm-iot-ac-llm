To calculate the minimum distance from neighbors, you can use the `foldhood` construct with `nbr` to gather the distances from neighbors and then find the minimum value. Here is the raw Scala code for the `main` function that accomplishes this:

```scala
val idsAndNeigh = foldhood(List.empty[(Double, ID)])(_ ++ _)(List(nbrRange() -> nbr(mid())))
idsAndNeigh.minBy(_._1)._1
```
