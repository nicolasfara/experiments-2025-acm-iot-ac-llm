Sure, let's calculate the minimum distance from the neighbors of each node. We will use the `foldhoodPlus` construct to exclude the node itself from the aggregation.

Here is the Scala code for calculating the minimum distance from the neighbors:

```scala
def main(): Double = minHoodPlus(nbrRange())
```

This code snippet uses the `minHoodPlus` function to calculate the minimum distance from the neighbors, excluding the node itself. The `nbrRange()` function is used to get the distance to each neighbor.
