To calculate the minimum distance from neighbors, you can use the `minHood` function provided by the DSL. This function will help you determine the minimum distance among the neighbors.

Here is the Scala code for calculating the minimum distance from neighbors:

```scala
minHood(nbrRange())
```

This code snippet uses the `minHood` function to find the minimum value of `nbrRange` among the neighbors.
